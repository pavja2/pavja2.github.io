    About the Project This is the second in a series of posts outlining my efforts to reverse engineer the new Amazon Dash Wand to understand how it works and how secure it is. Rather than just do the typical security blog writeup of exploits, I wanted to share the entire process including the numerous dead ends and false leads involved in an embedded reverse engineering effort.
You can find other posts in the series here.

    About the Project I recently picked up Amazon&rsquo;s new Dash Wand essentially for free due to an Amazon promotion ($20 worth of Amazon credits if you purchase the $20 device).
The device itself packs a pretty hefty amount of hardware for the cost. It includes a microphone, a linear image sensor for barcode reading, assorted LEDs, a nice big button, speakers, Bluetooth Low Energy and Wifi. It&rsquo;s all powered by (replaceable) AAA batteries, can be affixed to any magnetic surface or hung from an adhesive hook it ships with, and is remarkably compact and portable.

    Reverse Engineering: Dash Wand The Amazon Dash Wand packs some pretty powerful hardware in a cheap and attractive package. The only downside is that the device is locked down to the point where it&rsquo;s good for only one thing: making orders on Amazon. This project is about liberating the hardware, seeing how secure the wand really is, getting better control over my data, and learning a bit about IOT reverse-engineering.

    pavursec.com In addition to serving as the standard bootstrap-heavy web portfolio. This site provides a location for me to consolidate my thoughts, projects, and web persona as well as an opportunity to experiment with new technologies.
As I work on new projects they&rsquo;ll be added to this site - wherever they may be hosted. It also hosts my blog where I&rsquo;ll share my thoughts on cyberpolicy, security research discoveries and disclosures, and general technical musings.

    The Adventures of Hackergirl One of the greatest shortcomings of the information security industry today is the egregious gender gap among information security professionals. The fact that fewer than one in ten cybersecurity professionals are female directly increases the risks faced by our society in cyberspace.
Although successful and admirable efforts have been made to incorporate women into the software development world through organizations like Women Who Code, comparatively little thought has been paid to the gender gap in information security.
