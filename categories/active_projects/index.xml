      <description>Distributed applications lack reliable means of verifying the trustworthiness of their users and blockchain users have little information regarding the trustworthiness of distributed applications. EOShield was an hackathon competition entry at the 2018 EOS Global Hackathon which demonstrated the creation of a PKI-inspired distrubted trust model to reduce risk on DApp ecosystems.
The project was pitched as a business but is currently a side project intended for open-source release to the EOS community.</description>

      <description>Reverse Engineering: Dash Wand The Amazon Dash Wand packs some pretty powerful hardware in a cheap and attractive package. The only downside is that the device is locked down to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s good for only one thing: making orders on Amazon. This project is about liberating the hardware, seeing how secure the wand really is, getting better control over my data, and learning a bit about IOT reverse-engineering.</description>

      <description>pavursec.com In addition to serving as the standard bootstrap-heavy web portfolio. This site provides a location for me to consolidate my thoughts, projects, and web persona as well as an opportunity to experiment with new technologies.
As I work on new projects they&amp;rsquo;ll be added to this site - wherever they may be hosted. It also hosts my blog where I&amp;rsquo;ll share my thoughts on cyberpolicy, security research discoveries and disclosures, and general technical musings.</description>
