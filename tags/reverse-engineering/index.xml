      <description>Reverse Engineering: Dash Wand The Amazon Dash Wand packs some pretty powerful hardware in a cheap and attractive package. The only downside is that the device is locked down to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s good for only one thing: making orders on Amazon. This project is about liberating the hardware, seeing how secure the wand really is, getting better control over my data, and learning a bit about IOT reverse-engineering.</description>
