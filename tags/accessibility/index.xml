      <description>Typeface Typeface was the winner of the first Hoya Hacks hackathon at Georgetown University. The goal was to build a device that would allow even a fully paralyzed individual to communicated at a reasonable rate with loved ones.
The proof of concept device leverages the Muse Headband - a consumer product prices at less than $300 and targeted towards helping individuals meditate and improve mindfulness.
The UI of the project was inspired by stories of &amp;ldquo;tap codes&amp;rdquo; used by Vietnam Prisoners of War to communicate with each other without relying on the more complicated Morse Code.</description>
