      <description>Typeface Typeface was the winner of the first Hoya Hacks hackathon at Georgetown University. The goal was to build a device that would allow even a fully paralyzed individual to communicated at a reasonable rate with loved ones.
The proof of concept device leverages the Muse Headband - a consumer product prices at less than $300 and targeted towards helping individuals meditate and improve mindfulness.
The UI of the project was inspired by stories of &amp;ldquo;tap codes&amp;rdquo; used by Vietnam Prisoners of War to communicate with each other without relying on the more complicated Morse Code.</description>

      <description>Pi Guard Pi Guard was a hackathon project focused on filling the gap between consumer security options for personal computers and comparable offerings for embedded and internet of things products.
The device hosts a simple web application which acts as a wrapper for a number of automated scans that take place on the local IP range. The automated scans are designed to be modular and flexible so that multiple &amp;lsquo;plugins&amp;rsquo; might be written for the platform and the UI is oriented towards non-technical users.</description>

      <description>Pi Spy Pi spy was an entry my hackathon team made with the goal of demonstrating a novel attack vector against unencrypted network traffic.
The project revolved around a malicious NIC installation that included a raspberry-pi running tcpdump and a passive network tap that intercepted all traffic from the desktop&amp;rsquo;s ethernet port.
By powering the raspberry-pi off of the Molex adapters from the PC&amp;rsquo;s PSU we were able to ensure that the pi ran continuously whenever the PC was turned on.</description>
