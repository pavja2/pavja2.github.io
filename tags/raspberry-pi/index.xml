      <description>Pi Guard Pi Guard was a hackathon project focused on filling the gap between consumer security options for personal computers and comparable offerings for embedded and internet of things products.
The device hosts a simple web application which acts as a wrapper for a number of automated scans that take place on the local IP range. The automated scans are designed to be modular and flexible so that multiple &amp;lsquo;plugins&amp;rsquo; might be written for the platform and the UI is oriented towards non-technical users.</description>

      <description>Pi Spy Pi spy was an entry my hackathon team made with the goal of demonstrating a novel attack vector against unencrypted network traffic.
The project revolved around a malicious NIC installation that included a raspberry-pi running tcpdump and a passive network tap that intercepted all traffic from the desktop&amp;rsquo;s ethernet port.
By powering the raspberry-pi off of the Molex adapters from the PC&amp;rsquo;s PSU we were able to ensure that the pi ran continuously whenever the PC was turned on.</description>

      <description>Tea Pi As a huge tea aficionado, it makes sense that one of my first hardware projects was to #buildabetterteapot. Tea Pi began as a project worked on between classes in my freshman year dormitory at Georgetown. Although the assorted wires, inept soldering, and endless sessions of me yelling at a e-cycled web camera to get voice-controls to work may have unnerved my roommate, the end result was well worth it.</description>
