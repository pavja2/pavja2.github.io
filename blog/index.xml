      <description>Static == Secure Right? If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my recent post extolling the virtues of static site generators for secure web development you might think that deploying a static site makes you more or less invulnerable to cyber adversaries.

      <description>Juggling Priorities It should come as no surprise that, when building this site, my first concern was security.
