    About the Project This is the second in a series of posts outlining my efforts to reverse engineer the new Amazon Dash Wand to understand how it works and how secure it is. Rather than just do the typical security blog writeup of exploits, I wanted to share the entire process including the numerous dead ends and false leads involved in an embedded reverse engineering effort.
You can find other posts in the series here.

    About the Project I recently picked up Amazon&rsquo;s new Dash Wand essentially for free due to an Amazon promotion ($20 worth of Amazon credits if you purchase the $20 device).
The device itself packs a pretty hefty amount of hardware for the cost. It includes a microphone, a linear image sensor for barcode reading, assorted LEDs, a nice big button, speakers, Bluetooth Low Energy and Wifi. It&rsquo;s all powered by (replaceable) AAA batteries, can be affixed to any magnetic surface or hung from an adhesive hook it ships with, and is remarkably compact and portable.

    <h2> 15 Strategies to Win Hackathons </h2>

    Hackathons are a great deal of fun and also an opportunity to make connections with local tech companies, build a reputation, and grow as a coder. One of the best things about hackathons is the opportunity to win awesome prizes. Unfortunately the competition at hackathons can be tough. Indeed, sometimes hundreds of people will compete for a shot at only 3 or 4 prizes. It can be hard for a new hacker to stand out from the crowd.

    <h2> Hackathons vs. CTFs </h2>

    One piece of advice I give to people looking to transition from computer science homework assignments to meaningful proficiency in cybersecurity is to seek out Hackathons and Capture-the-Flag competitions.
Sometimes the amount of information on these events can seem overwhelming and it can be difficult for someone starting out to know which events are worthwhile and how to best make use of opportunities. After attending a number of these competitions myself, I wanted to share some of the advice I wish someone had given me.

    If you&rsquo;re about to go to your first CTF or have been to a handful, chances are you are looking for ways to improve your game and win some prizes. CTFs are generally very tough and with hundreds of people competing for a small handful of prizes you can expect to lose far more than you win. Unlike hackathons, where a little charm and confidence goes a long way, CTFs are often a straight test of technical knowledge and endurance.
